Open Data Sceince Platform
--------------------------

The Open Data Science Platform makes sharing data simple and standardized. 
Currently there's a real struggle to find publicly available data.  


What type of data?
==================

Everything from school science projects to fortune 500 public data
is encouraged to be published on the site. The more diverse the data the
better.

While we encourage individuals and companies to be open with their data,
we understand certain data cannot be shared. If there arises an issue
with sensitive data that is published please notify us ASAP via appropriate
contact methods on the site. Care must be taken in sharing data and 
our hope is to encourage the publishing of data through legal means.


What can I do with the data?
============================

The data we ask to be posted is done so through a GPL aggreement. This means
that you may use the data for whatever legal purposes you'd like, but if
you modify the data we ask that you simply publish it as a fork of the 
original data. By doing so you build your own profile and can give insights
to others about data they may not have conceptualized yet.


How can I help?
===============

Please contribute! Some of the following actions will be helpful:

* Submit Pull requests to improve code / security
* Analyze and publish data from existing repos
* Encourage Students, Professors, Companies, and others to release data
* Spread the word!
* Participate in 'State of the Data' monthly meetings
